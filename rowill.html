        videogames but mostly videogames my Guiding principles in life is Assume nothing, expect little, do
        more for others, need less for oneself, smile often, dream big, laugh a lot, and pray always. i like sports 
		mostly because of friends who like playing sports  specifically basketball i was very sporty on high school</br>
		year but because of the pandemic now i like playing more online, I am also a dog lover and a cat but more on dog because </br>

	   <p>Well how I'am alike and different from others is that we’re all human beings we feel emotions and how I am different from that is how I handle those emotions and I always find a solution to every problem I’ve had<br>
        my little accomplishments that I graduated senior high and opened a new path for my future my family  were proud I made it this far and I’m not planning on giving up just yet!!. </P>.

        </br>
		</br>
		
		<p> My future plans are to besuccessful help my family build a family and show those people who look down on us show them what
		I am capable of and show them to never judge a book by its cover u never know what a person can do in  life is hard but it isn’t about 
		how hard you hit it’s about hard you can get hit and keep moving forward  that’s how winning is done,i am an intresting,
		I'm also fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me is that is important to know though is that at first i come 
		as a very shy individualistic guy but once i get to know people and are comfortable with my environment i am great.
		It is hard to make friends but once i make them, it's great and i am different i joke, i laugh and humor people and i also get as much as i give,
		i am very kind, compassionate, sensitive guys as my close friends will tell you. i have a tough shell but on the inside, i am soft
		i am also a very principled person and stand strong on whats right and wrong i am also a very   straight and honest person. </p>
